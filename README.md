# MY BACKGROUND
I am neuropsychologist, I worked in a hospital where I did perisurgical evaluation with patients with cerebral tumor or pharmacoresistant epilepsy.
Then, I did my PhD in Caen, I worked on Huntington’s disease. More precisely I tried to understand social cognition impairments in this disease, using neuropsychologic tests, but also structural MRI and functional MRI related to a social cognition task.
Indeed, I tried to validate this social cognition task built in Caen, by showing activation of specific social cognition regions in control subjects.
I also tried to validate a predictive formula that correlates the age of onset of symptoms in huntington’s disease and the onset of cerebral atrophy in putamen and caudate nucleus 
And now, for this postdoc, I work on a different topic, I work on subjects in a very early stage of Alzheimer's (MCI and SCD).
The aim of this study is to use a multimodal approach, to evaluate the structural integrity of the connectivity and then correlating it to possible hyperconnections found during an episodic memory fMRI task. We want to know if these possible hyperconnections can reveal a mechanism of brain plasticity answering the deficit of structural connectivity in these subjects.

# MY PROJECT FOR THE BRAINHACK
I would like to learn methods for assessing task-related functional connectivity using graph theoretical methods. And if possible, I would like to learn how to make figures in connectivity like those below for example. 
I'm just starting the connectivity analysis so it's all new to me, so all I could learn about it will be great
